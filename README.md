# Python Projects - From Games to Machine Learning 🚀

Welcome to my collection of Python projects developed throughout my engineering journey! 🌟 From game development to machine learning, these projects range from beginner to intermediate proficiency.

What's Inside:
1. 🎮 Pong Game:
My first ever project for a game development hackathon, where we built a classic Pong game with an interactive GUI and scoring system. Proudly won 2nd place! 🏆

2. 🧩 Tetris Game:
Tetris with a twist! We added a stylish main menu, help window, and a polished UI that doesn’t compromise on aesthetics. It even has audio and scoring systems.

3. 🌐 Multilingual Vowel Classifier:
A prototype language-learning tool using machine learning. Predicts real-time user-drawn vowels from 5 languages (Russian, Greek, Korean, Japanese, Chinese) and maps them to their English equivalents. Perfect for language enthusiasts!

4. 📋 Productivity Tool:
A student-friendly app built with Tkinter that includes a Pomodoro timer, to-do lists, note-taking, and a calculator. Great for organizing daily study and work routines! 🎯

These projects blend creativity with logic – dive in and explore!

Happy coding! ✨
