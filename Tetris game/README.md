# 🎮 Tetris Game
This project is a classic implementation of the Tetris game, where players drop Tetrominoes (blocks made of four connected squares) into a playing field to clear lines and score points. The goal is to arrange the falling Tetrominoes and clear lines, with increasing speed at each level. 🧩✨

Key Features:
1. 🟦 Seven Types of Tetrominoes:
Players can move and rotate these pieces to fit them into the playing field.

2. 🚀 Increasing Difficulty:
As levels progress, Tetrominoes fall faster, challenging players to clear a set number of lines to advance. 🎯

3. 🎯 Scoring System:
  ⦿ Double: Clear two lines at once
  ⦿ Triple: Clear three lines
  ⦿ Tetris: Clear four lines
  ⦿ Back-to-Back Tetris: Consecutive Tetrises for extra points 🏆

4. 💥 Game Over:
The game ends when the Tetrominoes reach the top of the playing field. 🚧

5. 🎨 Smooth Gameplay and UI:
Built with Pygame, the user interface and gameplay mechanics ensure a seamless experience.

6. 🎵 Sound Effects & Music:
Using Tkinter Playsound, we’ve added background music and sound effects for a more immersive experience. 🎶🔊

This project recreates the fun and challenge of the classic Tetris game with smooth gameplay and an interactive UI. Enjoy the nostalgia and test your skills! 🕹️
