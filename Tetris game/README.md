**Tetris Game**

This project is a classic implementation of the **Tetris** game where players drop Tetrominoes, blocks made of four connected squares, into a playing field to clear lines and score points. The goal is to clear lines by arranging the falling Tetrominoes, with each level increasing the speed of the falling blocks.

Key Features:
- The game includes seven different types of Tetrominoes, and players can move and rotate them to fit into the playing field.
- As levels progress, Tetrominoes fall faster, and players aim to clear a set number of lines to advance to the next level.
- Scoring is based on the number of lines cleared at once: clearing two lines is called a "double," three lines a "triple," and four lines a "Tetris." Players can achieve a "back-to-back Tetris" by clearing consecutive Tetrises.
- The game ends when Tetrominoes reach the top of the playing field.
- **Pygame** was used to design the user interface, gameplay mechanics, and scoring system.
- **Tkinter Playsound** was integrated to add background music and sound effects for a more engaging gameplay experience.

This project recreates the fun and challenge of the classic Tetris game with smooth gameplay mechanics and an interactive UI.
