# 🌐 Multilingual Vowel Classifier
This project is a language-translation prototype aimed at classifying vowels from five languages: Chinese, Russian, Korean, Greek, and Japanese, and predicting their corresponding English characters. 🎯

Key Features:
1. ✏️ Draw Vowels:
Users can draw vowels on a provided canvas, and the system processes and classifies the drawings using pre-trained models or trains new ones! 🖼️✨

2. 🔍 Choose Your Model:
Pick from various machine learning models like LinearSVC, KNeighbors, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, and GaussianNB to predict the English characters with varying levels of precision! 🎛️🤖

3. 📊 Training Data:
Over 800 images of vowels from the mentioned languages form the dataset to train the model. 📸📝

4. 🖼️ PIL & OpenCV:
PIL (Python Imaging Library) is used for opening, manipulating, and saving images, while OpenCV handles image processing for seamless operation. 🖌️📷

5. 🔢 NumPy:
Images and their respective classes are stored in arrays using NumPy, helping train the model efficiently. 📈

6. ⚙️ scikit-learn:
Imported machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn power the training and testing of the model, ensuring solid performance. 🧠📚

7. 🖥️ User-Friendly GUI:
A simple, interactive GUI is built with Tkinter, making it easy for anyone to use! 🎨📋

8. 💾 Pre-trained Models:
Using Pickle, you can save and load the trained models, allowing for the use of pre-trained datasets to get quick and efficient predictions! 🚀💡

This project expands the use of drawing classification for language translation through machine learning and image processing, offering a fun and interactive tool for multilingual vowel recognition! 🌍🔠
